Abstract
This study develops a hybrid machine learning pipeline for ECG-based functional state assessment, combining feature-based classification with interpretable analysis and un-supervised clustering. The dataset, collected under field conditions from military per-sonnel, injured servicemen, rehabilitation cohorts, and civilian controls, underwent ex-tensive preprocessing, including imputation, outlier capping, correlation filtering, and normalization, yielding 18 representative physiological and psychophysiological fea-tures. Clustering with HDBSCAN revealed two robust macro-clusters: one encompassing frontline and training personnel, and the other comprising hospital and rehabilitation groups, while the civilian control group showed excessive heterogeneity and was ex-cluded from most analyses. Gradient boosting classifiers achieved high accuracy (≈0.97–0.98) in supervised classification, confirming objective separability of clusters. SHAP analysis identified S-wave amplitude (lead I), J40 amplitude, and the composite MYOCARDIUM index as key discriminators, with secondary contributions from psy-cho-emotional state, total power of HRV, and repolarization indices. These markers plausibly reflect physiological distinctions between active-duty and recovery states. The results demonstrate that combining interpretable ML models with nonlinear embedding and density-based clustering provides both reliable classification and physiologically meaningful insights. This approach extends conventional ECG analysis toward compre-hensive monitoring of functional readiness, stress, and adaptation, with potential appli-cations in military and occupational medicine.
